/**
  * Class RebalanceJob represents a tool which will rebalance replica disposition
  * accross worker nodes in order to achieve close-to-equal dstribution of chunks
  * across workers.
  *
  * These are basic requirements to the algorithm:
  *
  * - key metrics for the algorithm are:
  *     + a database family to be rebalanced
  *     + total number of replicas within a database family
  *     + the total number and names of workers which are available (up and running)
  *     + the average number of replicas per worker node
  *
  * - rebalance each database family independently of each other because
  *   this should still yeld an equal distribution of chunks accross any database
  *
  * - a subject of each move is (chunk,all databases of the family) residing
  *   on a node
  *
  * - the operation deals with 'good' (meaning 'colocated' and 'complete')
  *   chunk replicas only
  *
  * - the operation won't affect the number of replicas, it will only
  *   move replicas between workers
  *
  * - when rebalancing is over then investigate two options: finish it and launch
  *   it again externally using some sort of a scheduler, or have an internal ASYNC
  *   timer (based on Boost ASIO).
  *
  * - in the pilot implementation replica disposition should be requested directly
  *   from the worker nodes using precursor FindAllJob. More advanced implementation
  *   may switch to pulling this informtion from a database. That would work better
  *   at a presence of other activities keeping the database content updated.
  *
  * - [TO BE CONFIRMED] at a each iteration a limited number (from the Configuration?)
  *   of replicas will be processed. Then chunk disposition will be recomputed to adjust
  *   for other parallel activities (replication, purge, etc.).
