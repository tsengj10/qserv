  * Class DeleteWorkerJob represents a tool which will disable a worker
  * from any active use in a replication setup. All chunks hosted by
  * the worker node will be distributed accross the cluster.
  *
  * Specific steps made by the job:
  * 1. check the status of the worker service (SYNC, short timeout),
  *    1.1 if it responds then:
  *        1.1.0 memorize the status of the worker service (may need it later)
  *        1.1.1 drain all requests on that service (SYNC, short timeout)
  *        1.1.2 submit FindAllRequsts against the worker for all known databases
  *              to refresh a list of replicas on that node (ASYNC)
  *        1.1.3 when all requests finish then stop the worker service (SYNC, short timeout)
  *        1.1.4 proceed to step 2
  *     1.2 otherwise:
  *        1.2.1 proceed to step 2
  * 2. change the status of the worker
  *    2.1 disable worker in the configuration
  *    2.2 update a disposition of chunks accross the rest of the cluster (ASYNC)
  * 3. launch the replication job ReplicateJob (ASYNC, long timeout)
  * 4. analyze results when the job will finish a report on which replicas were
  *    made and which could not be made will be prepared. See struct DeleteWorkerJobResult
  *    defined above for specific details.
  *    4.1 load a list of affected worker's replicas from the database
  *    4.2 if such orpgans found check 1.0 to see if the worker service could
  *        be reactivated to pull those missing replicas from that node
