#   This folder containes instructions and the Dockerfile for building
#   a development container for the Replication system

# These are the optional building steps (in case if this container needs to
# be rebuilt from scratch (which is going to take ~2 hours or longer)

docker build -t qserv/replica:dev .
docker push qserv/replica:dev

# Alternatively one can pull an existing container from DockerHub (provided
# a proper login into the hub was made earlier)

docker pull qserv/replica:dev

# This is an example of how to use the container to build qserv from the source code.
# The '-v $PWD:$PWD' mounts the  hosts's folder inside the container. This folder
# is writeable.

cd /home/user/qserv

docker run \
    --rm \
    -it \
    -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    -v /etc/passwd:/etc/passwd:ro \
    -v /etc/group:/etc/group:ro \
    -v $PWD:$PWD \
    -e "SOURCE=${PWD}" \
    qserv/replica:dev bash

# Once logged into the runing container do:
#
# NOTE: you may also check if your account (as mapped above) has required
#       privileges to your home folder.
